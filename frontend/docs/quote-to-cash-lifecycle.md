  issue_date: Date
  due_date: Date

## Navigation Updates

Add to main navigation:

3. **DSO**: Days Sales Outstanding
4. **Collection Rate**: % of invoices paid on time
5. **Process Efficiency**: Time saved per transaction

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create this documentation
2. üöß Implement Quote-to-Order conversion modal
3. ‚è≥ Build Invoice management page
4. ‚è≥ Build Payment recording page
5. ‚è≥ Create AR dashboard
