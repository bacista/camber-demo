## Conclusion

Camber's current implementation shows strong foundational elements (OCR, confidence scoring, multi-source tracking) but lacks critical features for B2B distribution success. The highest priorities are mobile support and payment terms, which directly impact customer adoption. The planned voice interface represents a genuine market differentiator that aligns with Camber's AI-first vision.

The path forward should focus on:
1. **Immediate:** Mobile + payment terms
2. **Near-term:** Bulk operations + inventory visibility
3. **Strategic:** Voice interface + AI recommendations

This approach balances quick wins with long-term differentiation, positioning Camber as the AI-driven leader in B2B order automation.
