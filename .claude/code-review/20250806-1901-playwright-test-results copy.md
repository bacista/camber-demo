## Issues Found

### 🔴 Critical Issues
1. **Missing API Implementation**
   - `/api/quotes` endpoint returns 404
   - `/api/orders` endpoint returns 404
   - Impact: Core functionality incomplete for production use

2. **Incomplete Navigation**
   - 50% of navigation links lead to 404 pages:
     - `/customers` - Not implemented
     - `/products` - Not implemented
     - `/analytics` - Not implemented
     - `/integrations` - Not implemented
     - `/settings` - Not implemented
   - Impact: User experience broken for major sections

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues
1. **No Authentication System**
   - Application runs in demo mode with pre-authenticated user "Sarah Chen"
   - No login/logout functionality
   - Impact: Security concern for production deployment

2. **Limited Test Coverage**
   - 43.75% of tests could not be executed without browser automation
   - Interactive elements untested
   - Impact: Quality assurance incomplete

### 🟢 Minor Issues
1. **No Error Pages**
   - Generic 404 pages for missing routes
   - No custom error handling
   - Impact: Poor user experience for errors
