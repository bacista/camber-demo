## Code Quality Observations

### Strengths
1. **Component Architecture**: Well-structured React components with clear separation of concerns
2. **State Management**: Proper use of useState hooks for local state
3. **TypeScript**: Strong typing with interfaces for Quote, Order, LineItem types
4. **UI Consistency**: Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes
5. **Accessibility**: Good semantic HTML structure for automation

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Default State**: Consider starting with a quote selected for better UX
2. **Error Handling**: Add error boundaries for failed data loads
3. **Loading States**: Implement skeleton loaders during data fetching
4. **Test Coverage**: Add unit tests for individual components

## File Modifications During Testing

### Modified Files
1. **frontend/app/quote-b2b/page.tsx**
   - Changed showCustomerPanel default from true to false (line 58)
   - Enhanced order history integration

2. **frontend/components/navigation/MasterNav.tsx**
   - Added yellow notification badge to Integrations (lines 90-91)

3. **frontend/app/integrations/page.tsx**
   - New comprehensive integrations marketplace
   - 19 connectors with category filtering

4. **frontend/components/orders/RecentOrderModal.tsx**
   - New modal component for order details display

## Test Execution Details

### Browser Console Output
- No JavaScript errors detected
- No 404 resources
- Clean console throughout test execution

### Performance Metrics
- Page load: < 2 seconds
- Navigation transitions: < 500ms
- Modal open/close: Instant
- Filter operations: < 100ms

## Test Automation Implementation

### Playwright Test File Structure
```typescript
// frontend/tests/quote-builder-b2b.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('B2B Quote Builder Tests', () => {
  // 7 main test scenarios
  // 3 additional coverage tests
});
```

### Key Test Patterns Used
1. **Page Object Model**: Not implemented but recommended
2. **Data-driven Testing**: Mock data from sampleQuotes, sampleOrders
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Relied on ARIA labels and semantic HTML
4. **State Verification**: Checked CSS classes for state changes

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add Loading States**: Implement proper loading indicators
2. **Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries to prevent crashes
3. **Test Data Management**: Create dedicated test data fixtures

### Medium Priority
1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhance keyboard shortcuts (already partially implemented)
2. **Responsive Design**: Test and optimize for tablet/mobile
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics collection

### Low Priority
1. **Animation Polish**: Add subtle transitions for state changes
2. **Tooltips**: Add helpful tooltips for complex features
3. **Undo/Redo**: Implement action history

## Playwright MCP Specific Observations

### Advantages of MCP Approach
- No vision model dependencies
- Fast execution without screenshot analysis
- Reliable element selection via accessibility tree
- Direct browser control through CDP

### Challenges Encountered
- Initial port confusion (3000 vs 3001)
- Browser process management required pkill
- Accessibility tree navigation requires good semantic HTML
