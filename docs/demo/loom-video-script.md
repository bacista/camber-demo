# Loom Video Script: Combined Quote → Order Flow

## Opening (0:00-0:20)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - Left shows cluttered desk with papers, calculator, multiple screens. Right shows clean Camber interface]**

**[WEBCAM: On, friendly greeting]**

"If your inside sales team is like most distributors, they're spending 15 hours every week manually building quotes and entering orders. That's almost two full days of selling time—lost.

I'm [Your Name] from Camber, and in the next 3 minutes, I'll show you exactly how we turn a 45-minute quote into a 45-second process—and automatically convert accepted quotes into orders with zero manual entry.

Let's dive in."

## Quote Generation Demo (0:20-1:20)

**[SCREEN: Camber dashboard]**

"Here's what happens when a customer sends an RFQ.

**[ACTION: Drag and drop RFQ PDF]**

First, I'll simply drag this customer's request right into Camber. This could be a PDF, an email, even a photo from their phone.

**[SCREEN: Extraction in progress with progress bar]**

Watch this—our AI is reading the document and extracting every line item. No templates needed, no manual typing.

**[SCREEN: Product matching interface showing confidence scores]**

Now here's where it gets interesting. Camber automatically matches these items to your catalog. See these confidence scores? Green means exact match, yellow means we found alternatives.

**[SCREEN: Pricing screen with margin indicators]**

And here's the magic—real-time pricing with your margin rules built in. Notice how it flags this item in red? That's below your 15% margin threshold. One click to adjust.

**[ACTION: Click "Generate Quote"]**

Now I'll generate the quote...

**[SCREEN: Professional PDF quote appears]**

And there it is. Professional quote, your branding, delivered in 45 seconds instead of 45 minutes.

**[ANNOTATION: "Time saved: 44 minutes per quote"]**

## Smart Transition (1:20-1:30)

**[SCREEN: Email notification pops up]**

"Now here's where Camber really shines. Three days later, your customer accepts the quote and sends their PO.

Watch what happens next—this is where most systems stop, but Camber's just getting started."

## Order Automation Demo (1:30-2:20)

**[SCREEN: Email with PO attachment in inbox]**

"The purchase order arrives by email. In the old world, someone prints this, manually enters it, hopes they don't make mistakes.

**[SCREEN: Camber automatically processing]**

But watch—Camber's already reading the PO, matching it to the original quote, and validating the pricing.

**[SCREEN: Order creation screen with all fields populated]**

Every field is populated automatically. The system even catches that they ordered 500 units instead of the quoted 400—and adjusts the volume discount.

**[SCREEN: Approval routing diagram]**

Based on your rules, orders over $10,000 route to management. Under that? Straight to fulfillment.

**[ACTION: Show order status changing to "Ready for ERP"]**

And just like that—order created, validated, and ready for your ERP. No manual entry, no errors, no delays.

**[ANNOTATION: "0% manual entry errors"]**

## ROI & Metrics (2:20-2:45)

**[SCREEN: Split screen dashboard showing before/after metrics]**

**[WEBCAM: On for emphasis]**

"Let me show you what this means for your team.

Before Camber: 15 hours per week on quotes and orders.
After Camber: 2 hours per week for oversight.

That's 13 hours back for selling.

Your error rate drops from 12% to less than 1%.
Quote turnaround goes from 2 days to 30 minutes.
And here's my favorite stat—quote-to-order conversion increases by 23% because you're responding faster than your competition.

**[ANNOTATION: "ROI in week 1"]**

## Call to Action (2:45-3:00)

**[SCREEN: Calendar booking page]**

**[WEBCAM: On, direct to camera]**

"Look, I know you've seen a lot of demos. But we're not asking you to rip and replace anything.

We're onboarding 3 pilot customers this month. 6 weeks, full support, and you'll see ROI in the first week.

Click the link below to book 15 minutes with me. I'll show you this live with your actual products and pricing.

## Director's Notes

### Energy
Keep it conversational but confident. You're showing a friend something cool, not giving a corporate presentation.

### Pacing
Each section should feel distinct. Use pauses between major transitions.

### Mouse Movement
Deliberate and smooth. Hover over important elements before clicking.

### Annotations
Add these in post using Loom's tools. Don't try to explain everything verbally.

### Webcam Usage
On for intro, transition, and closing. Off during detailed demo sections.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't apologize or say "let me just..."
- Don't mention technical issues
- Keep moving forward even if something small goes wrong

### Practice Run
Do one full run-through before recording. Have all tabs/windows ready.
