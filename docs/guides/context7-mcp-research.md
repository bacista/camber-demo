          "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Method 3: HTTP Transport
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "httpUrl": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Finding 5: Configuration Options and Best Practices
**Sources**: GitHub, developer tutorials [High Confidence]
**Summary**: Flexible configuration with runtime alternatives
**Evidence**:
- **Bun runtime**: Use `bunx` instead of `npx`
- **Deno runtime**: Use `deno run --allow-net`
- **Best practices**:
  - Restart Claude Code after configuration changes
  - Verify installation with `claude mcp list`
  - Look for MCP indicator in UI
  - Use `~/.claude.json` for consistent behavior

### Finding 6: Use Cases for Frontend Web Application Testing
**Sources**: Developer blogs, MCP documentation [Medium Confidence]
**Summary**: Indirect testing support through accurate documentation
**Evidence**:
- **Primary benefits**:
  - Ensures testing code uses current API methods
  - Reduces errors from deprecated functions
  - Provides accurate framework-specific testing patterns
  - Supports test framework documentation (Jest, Cypress, etc.)
- **Complementary use**: Works alongside dedicated testing MCPs like Playwright MCP
- **Documentation support for**: React, Next.js, Vue, Angular testing patterns

### Finding 7: Example Commands and Usage Patterns
**Sources**: Official documentation, tutorials [High Confidence]
**Summary**: Simple activation via "use context7" suffix
**Evidence**:
```
Examples:
- "Create a Next.js 14 app with routing. use context7"
- "Write Jest tests for React components. use context7"
- "Configure Cypress for E2E testing. use context7"
- "Implement authentication in FastAPI. use context7"
- "Create a Cloudflare Worker with caching. use context7"
```

### Finding 8: Integration with Existing Testing Tools
**Sources**: MCP ecosystem documentation [Medium Confidence]
**Summary**: Designed to enhance rather than replace existing tools
**Evidence**:
- Works alongside Playwright MCP for comprehensive testing
- Complements CI/CD pipelines by ensuring accurate code generation
- Can be used with multiple MCP servers simultaneously
- Supports testing frameworks: Jest, Cypress, Playwright documentation

## Comparison Matrix

## Recommendations

### For Frontend Testing Strategy:
1. **Install both Context7 and Playwright MCP** for comprehensive coverage
2. **Use Context7** for ensuring test code accuracy and framework-specific patterns
3. **Use Playwright MCP** for actual browser automation and test execution
4. **Workflow**: Write tests with Context7's documentation support, execute with Playwright

### Implementation Priority:
1. **High Priority**: Install Context7 immediately for improved code accuracy
2. **Medium Priority**: Add Playwright MCP for automated testing capabilities
3. **Low Priority**: Explore additional MCP servers based on specific needs

## Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence**: Installation procedures, basic functionality, comparison with Playwright
- **Medium Confidence**: Complete list of supported libraries, advanced configuration options
- **Low Confidence**: Performance metrics, scalability limits

## Limitations and Considerations
- Context7 requires internet connection for fetching documentation
- Documentation quality depends on source library's documentation
- Not a replacement for dedicated testing tools
- May increase prompt processing time slightly
