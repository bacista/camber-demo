**One-Liner**

Camber is an AI-driven sales automation platform for industrial and building material suppliers.

**Blurb**

[Camber](http://camber.supply/) is building the AI agent for the material supply chain. We specialize in AI-driven sales automation, helping sales teams reclaim up to 20 hours per week lost to admin. Our north star is transforming distribution channels through intelligence, helping suppliers unblock workflows and unlock value across the two-trillion-dollar materials market that powers North America.

The sales force trends older (median seller age is 55+ at many firms). Businesses are often long-term family owned. Unlike a decade or two ago, homegrown talent is harder to find. Fewer entry level folks are entering the industry, and those that do often jump shortly after joining (“*Why sell MEP supplies at a counter at $25/hour when I can clear $90k+ running your own shop as a plumbing contractor?”)*  

We make sellers 5x more efficient. We pick up the phone, process orders, respond to inquiries, draft and email quotes, schedule follow ups – working in the background so that your sales guy can spend more time onsite with customers, building trust and winning more business.

**Backstory**

I’ve been in the supply chain my whole life. My dad runs a distributor. I’ve seen firsthand how manual workflows eat away at profits. I ran sales transformation at Covetrus and saw how opaque and archaic systems make it so hard to set prices competitively and move sales opportunities from quotes to orders to cash in the bank.  

**Opportunity**

I estimate that there are about $20bn of “quick wins” across the materials supply industry –in  workflow efficiency and visibility alone. Value that can be delivered in the next five years with no additional innovation on existing technology. 

I think that a conservative view of intelligence gains, there’s maybe $500bn of incremental value captured over ten years: margin dollars that are essentially “up for grabs” for suppliers–existing or new– that meet the market with tools/processes/intelligence that just makes it dead simple to operate and win.

### **Primary User Persona**

A quota-carrying inside-sales or customer-support rep who:

* Enters purchase orders and responds to quote/pricing inquiries daily  
* Balances dozens of open quotes, supplier negotiations, and customer callbacks  
* Values intuitive, workflow-integrated tools that save time and help win deals faster

### **Typical Pre-Camber Workflow**

1. Receive RFQ by email/phone  
2. Hunt through spreadsheets & price lists to build a quote  
3. Send quote, track follow-ups in notes or inbox  
4. Check inventory in a separate system; coordinate fulfillment manually  
5. Update order status in CRM/ERP after the fact

**Examples of Workflows We Address**

| Work to be done | Everyday Scenario (Before Camber) | Typical Pain Points Exposed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Manual Quote Build** | Rep receives an RFQ by email → opens vendor price sheets in Excel → copy/pastes current costs into a Word template → double-checks math with a calculator → emails PDF to customer. | \- Human error in pricing or math \- 30–45 min turnaround per quote |
| **2\. Order Entry by Hand** | After a quote is accepted, rep re-keys line items into ERP order screen → prints pick ticket for warehouse → emails confirmation to customer. | \- Duplicate data entry \- Typos cause shipping errors |
| **3\. Inventory Check & “I’ll Call You Back”** | Customer asks if 2-inch PVC elbows are in stock → rep places them on hold → opens a separate inventory dashboard that updates hourly → promises to confirm within the hour. | \- Out-of-date snapshots \- Lost sales when stock is misreported |
| **4\. “Where’s My Truck?”** | Customer phones for delivery ETA → rep rings warehouse dispatcher → dispatcher calls carrier → rep calls customer back 15 min later. | \- Time-consuming phone tag \- No proactive status alerts |
| **5\. Spec Inquiry Scramble** | Contractor needs chemical-resistance data on a gasket → rep digs through PDF catalogs or calls the manufacturer’s tech hotline. | \- Slow answers, inconsistent info |
| **6\. Escalation Roulette** | Large hospital buyer pushes back on price → junior rep pings sales manager on Teams → manager is on the road → customer waits for a revised quote. | \- Friction handing off high-touch accounts |
| **7\. Sticky-Note Follow-Ups** | Rep keeps a stack of Post-its for “call back in 3 days” tasks → misses two callbacks after vacation → quotes expire, opportunities go cold. | \- Lost deals due to forgotten follow-ups |
| **8\. Cut-and-Paste Between Systems** | Pricing lives in ERP, contacts in CRM, quotes in Word, emails in Outlook → rep spends the last 30 min of each day logging activities. | \- Fragmented data; no single source of truth |
| **9\. Activity Black Hole** | Sales manager requests a report on “quotes sent vs. closed” by product line → rep exports ERP data to CSV, manually tags lines, builds pivot tables. | \- Late, error-prone reporting; zero real-time insight |

### **Channel Prioritization for Go-to-Market**

* My hypothesis is that the most fragmented channels (many small distributors, many suppliers) have the biggest tech-enablement gap, which creates a “white-space” opportunity for automation and data tools.
