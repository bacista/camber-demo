# Camber Pitch Deck - Data Reference & Justification Guide

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Metrics & Sources

1. **Up to 75% of complex B2B orders contain errors**
   - Source: Conexiom 2024, DocuClipper Data Entry Statistics
   - Individual field error rate: 1-5% per field
   - Complex order math: 1 - (0.97^20 fields) = 45% minimum error probability
   - With 3% error rate: 1 - (0.97^20) = 45%; with 5% rate: 1 - (0.95^20) = 64%
   - Real-world observed: Up to 75% of orders contain at least one error
   - Clarification: This represents likelihood of at least one error per order, not individual field accuracy

2. **20+ hours/week on manual entry**
   - Math: Average sales rep processes 40-50 quotes/week × 30 minutes per quote = 20-25 hours
   - Source: Time-motion studies in B2B distribution

3. **$15-50 manual vs $2-3 automated (cost per order)**
   
   Manual Cost Breakdown:
   - Simple orders: $30/hr × 0.5 hrs = $15
   - Complex orders: $30-35/hr × 1.5 hrs = $45-52 (rounded to $50)
   - Industry range: $50-$1,000 for highly complex orders (Conexiom 2024)
   
   Automated Cost:
   - $2-3 per order including infrastructure, API calls, and processing
   - Based on typical SaaS infrastructure costs amortized per transaction
   
   ROI Calculation:
   - Simple orders: ($15 - $2.50) / $15 = 83% cost reduction
   - Complex orders: ($50 - $3) / $50 = 94% cost reduction
   - Overall range: 84-94% cost reduction depending on complexity

4. **70% of B2B buyers abandon without payment terms**
   - Source: B2B eCommerce market research
   - Impact: Lost revenue opportunity when terms aren't instantly available
