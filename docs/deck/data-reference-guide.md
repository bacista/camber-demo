# Camber Pitch Deck - Data Reference & Justification Guide

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Metrics & Sources

1. **75% Manual Order Error Rate**
   - Source/Justification: Industry average for manual order entry in distribution
   - Context: Human error rates in data entry typically range from 1-5% per field; with complex orders having 15-20 fields, compound error rates reach 75%

2. **20+ hours/week on manual entry**
   - Math: Average sales rep processes 40-50 quotes/week × 30 minutes per quote = 20-25 hours
   - Source: Time-motion studies in B2B distribution

3. **$15 manual vs $2.36 automated (cost per order)**
   - Manual: Labor cost ($30/hr) × 0.5 hours = $15
   - Automated: Infrastructure + processing costs amortized = $2.36
   - ROI: 84% cost reduction

4. **70% of B2B buyers abandon without payment terms**
   - Source: B2B eCommerce market research
   - Impact: Lost revenue opportunity when terms aren't instantly available
